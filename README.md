This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where the request handler lacks a response, leading to unresponsive servers.  The `bug.js` file illustrates the problematic code.  `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from forgetting to use `res.send()` or `res.json()` to send a response to the client, resulting in a hanging request.  The solution involves adding a suitable response within the request handler.
